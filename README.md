- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeoLawrence.
- 👀 I work at the intersection between Software Engineering, Data Science, and Machine Learning Engineering.
- 🌱 My hobby project is Machine Learning Engineering with PyTorch. More specificially, I am implementing fine tuning LLMs to run on Tesla T4 GPUs using [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314). The goal is to one day help people run on-prem local LLMs to 1. ensure privacy for enterprise security and 2. reduce cloud dependence.
- 📝 My work experience primarily involves the Microsoft stack (C#, .NET, ASP.NET, WPF, Blazor, SQL Server) as well as Oracle DB (PL/SQL) for some essential applications. I use Python data analysis and data wrangling (Jupyter Notebook).
