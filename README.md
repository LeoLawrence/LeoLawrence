- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeoLawrence.
- 👀 I am a Software Engineer and Data Scientist.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on full-stack development in JavaScript for personal projects and improving my PyTorch skills for data science.
- 📝 The tech stack I use at my job is C# with ASP, WPF, .NET 8, OracleDB, and SQL server. I use Bitbucket for work so there are relatively few commits on this account. Bitbucket has a daily commit 5 days per week for work. I am coding more outside of work as of late-Jan, so I will be consistently committing more.
- 📫 Reach me at leo.lawrence@rutgers.edu or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leozlawrence/).
- My website is still a WIP. Once it is available, you can check out https://leolawrence.github.io/ for more information about me. Estimate for website completion is also TBD.
