- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeoLawrence.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development in JavaScript for personal projects.
- 📝 The tech stack I use at my job is C# with ASP, WPF, .NET 8, OracleDB (sometimes), and SQL server (most of the time).
- 📫 Reach me at leo.lawrence@rutgers.edu or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leozlawrence/).
- My website is still a WIP. Once it is available, you can check out https://leolawrence.github.io/ for more information about me.
