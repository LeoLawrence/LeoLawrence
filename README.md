- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeoLawrence.
- 👀 I work at the intersection between Software Engineering and Data Science.
- 🌱 My hobby project is Machine Learning Engineering with PyTorch. More specificially, I am implementing fine tuning LLMs to run on Tesla T4 GPUs using [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314)
- 📝 My job primarily uses the Microsoft stack (C#, .NET, ASP.NET, WPF, SQL Server) as well as Oracle DB (PL/SQL) for some essential applications. I use Python data analysis and data wrangling (Jupyter Notebook).
- 📫 Reach me at leo.lawrence@rutgers.edu or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leozlawrence/).
